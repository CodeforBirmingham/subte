Subte is an application to manage public transit data. It can create stops, build routes and timetables, and export to [General Transit Feed Specification](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference) data which can be used by Google Transit, Open Trip Planner, and others.

This software was developed by [Marcus Dillavou](http://line72.net) to aid in building transite data for the [Birmingham-Jefferson County Transit Authority](http://www.bjcta.org) in Birmingham, AL. For more information, please see the project [website](http://line72.net/index.php/software/subte/)
