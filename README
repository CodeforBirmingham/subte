Subte is an application to manage public transit data. It can create stops, build routes and timetables, and export to GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) data which can be used by Google Transit, Open Trip Planner, and others.

This software was developed by Marcus Dillavou <line72@line72.net> (http://line72.net) to aid in building transite data for the BJCTA [Birmingham-Jefferson County Transit Authority] (http://www.bjcta.org) in Birmingham, AL. For more information, please see the project website:
